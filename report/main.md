# Introduction
> "Pointing will still be the way to express nouns as we command our machines;
> speech is surely the right way to express the verbs."
**Frederick P. Brooks Jr., 1995**

## The Problem
According to the 2014 National Cancer Patient Experience Survey National Report,
over the past couple of years only slightly over 20% of cancer patients across the UK reported having been
offered an assassment and care plan specific to their personal circumstances
(Quality Health, 2014, p. 114).
In an effort to increase the number of cancer patients who received such
assessments, Macmillan Cancer Support piloted the Holistic Needs Assessment
(HNA) questionnaire and health plan in 2008 (Macmillan, [Holistic Needs Assessment][hna]).
This is essentially a self-assessment questionnaire where the patient identifies
what their concerns are from a range of personal, physical, emotional and practical
issues they may be facing in their lives in relation to their condition.
The completion of the questionnaire is followed by the creation of a care plan
through a consultation with a clinician, with further advice and referrals as
needed. Macmillan began trialing an electronic version of the questionnaire in
2010, progressively extending provision of the eHNA to more and more sites
(clinics etc) (Mac Voice, 2014).

Intelligent conversation systems have enjoyed an increasing amount of media
attention over the last year[^aiarticles]. With applications of artificial
intelligence to using natural language inputs for different purposes, including
general purpose mobile device interfaces[^viv]. Furthermore, several technology
companies have started offering "Artificial Intelligence as a Service" products.
Among these are BloomsburyAI (founded at UCL) and bespoken companies such as
Google and Microsoft[^aiaas]. This appears indicative of the fact that chatbot
and natural language processing technologies have reached a level of maturity
comparable to that achieved years ago by haptic technology, that we find almost ubiquitously
in human-computer interfaces and everyday use of computing devices today.

This project is a about the use of an intelligent conversational system
to gather further information about the patient's concerns through an electronic
self-assessment tool, ahead of the creation of a patient care plan. This is primarily
an attempt at introducing the conversational User Interface in electronic
health applications generally, and in particular explore the applicability of
computer advisors to Macmillan's eHNA in a growing effort to improve the
quality of support cancer patients receive across the UK.

The scope of the present report is limited to the architecture and implementation of the chatbot
system, as opposed to a complete, user-facing product: the complete application is a joint effort of four,
with distinct concerns being assigned to different members of the team. The
author of the present document being tasked with design and implementation of the core system backend. The
other members of the chatbot team include: Andre Allorerung (MSc SSE) as the
technical team lead who also takes care of the integration of the system with
the resources available to PEACH and the data storage system that will persist
durably information gathered through the chatbot system. Rim Ahsaini (MSc CS)
working on a specialized search engine for resources that may interest and help
support cancer patients based on their concerns (to be available both through
conversation with the chatbot and independently), Deborah Wacks (MSc CS) as lead
UX designer working on the implementation of a webserver through which allow the
user to interact with the chatbot and search engine.

This project is part of PEACH: Platform for Enhanced Analytics and Computational
Healthcare (Project PEACH, 2016). PEACH is a data science project that
originated at University College London (UCL) in 2016 that sees Master level
candidates working together on the data platform and on related projects. With
more than twenty students across multiple Master courses, it is one of the
largest student projects undertaken in recent years at UCL, and it is part of
a long-term strategy to bring the UCL Computer Science department and the UCL Hospital
closer together.

## Project goals and personal aims
The main project goal is the delivery of a basic but easy to extend and modify
chatbot software system, specifically targeted at assisting with the identification
and gathering of information around cancer patient issues, modelled after the
Concerns Checklist (CC) electronic questionnaire form (NCSI, 2012).
Finally, one of the major challenges with eHealth problems is represented by
having to hand confidential patient data (as will be discussed in Chapter 2 of
this report). Summarily:

- Design and implement a chatbot architecture tailored to the issues surrounding
software systems in healthcare (in particular around treatment of sensitive patient data)
- To integrate with a specialized search engine (developed by another member of the team)
- To explore other applications of NLP that could be useful to extract information from natural language data.
- To implement a chatbot brain using open source technology.
- To develop the system with Macmillan eHNA as the main reference.

Personal goals of the author include:

- Learning Python in an effort to gain exposure to a new programming language
- Leverage the author's background in computational linguistics, and explore
the field of natural language processing
- Learn about applications of machine learning to natural language processing
- Improve software engineering skills by applying best Agile practices

## The project approach methodology
An Agile approach was adopted for the project, in line
with the author's stated interests. This meant maximizing time spent outside of
meetings, save for where communication between team members and others was required.
The project was paced in weekly iterations where aspects of the system to implement
would be selected from a backlog to be delivered for the next week. Great
emphasis was also put on testing as part of deveopment, in particular the discipline
of Test Driven Development.

A top-down system design and implementation was also adopted, with the next largest system
abstraction being priorized first in development in order to always have a
working system being progressively refined. These methodology guidelines where established in accordance with
the reccomendations of Brooks (1995, pp143-144, 200-201, 267-271) and Martin (2009, pp121-133).

## Report overview
This report is structured as follows:

- Chapter 2 provides more extensive background into the eHNA questionnaire as well as
NLP and chatbot open source projects that were explored.
- Chapter 3 describes the requirements as gathered through the contacts in healthcare
and the Macmillan charity available to PEACH.
- Chapter 4 details the system architecture, design and the current implementation,
highlighting its current limits and its extensibility.
- Chapter 5 discusses how system testing was done as part of development, the
benefits of TDD to systems design and the evaluation of the machine learning component
of the system.
- Chapter 6 concludes with an evaluation of the project results, a team retrospective
and reccomendations for the direction of future work on the system.

## The electronic Health Needs Assessment questionnaire

### Macmillan Cancer Support
The eHNA system represents the background project against which the PEACH chatbot
team efforts have kept constant reference to from the project inception throughout
development.

Macmillan Cancer Support developed the eHNA for the purpose of extending the
range of cancer patients in the UK covered by individual care plans, made with
the individual's very personal and unique concerns they incurred into in relation
to their condition. These concerns are gathered through variants
of an electronic questionnaire offered by Macmillan to selected trial sites.
Paper versions and variants of the questionnaire
existed before the introduction of the eHNA in 2010, and have been in use since before then (Mac Voice, 2014) (NCAT, 2011).

The electronic questionnaire is designed to be carried out on site mostly through
haptic devices (such as tablets), just ahead of meeting the clinician that will help draft a care plan for the patient. There
is the option to complete the questionnaire remotely, although the adoption of
this alternative is made difficult by the work habits of key personnel, who are
used to providing a device to the patient in person and ask them to carry out the
questionnaire while at the clinic.

The patient uses device touch interface to navigate through various pages
selecting concern categories from a predefined list. There are several versions
of questionnaires available, modelled after the various paper versions, depending on which
one the clinic previously used.

Patients typically select three-four concerns (up to around six, mostly depending
on the type of cancer they have). The questionnaire takes on average less than
10 minutes to complete. The information extracted is first stored in a Macmillan
data store, external to the NHS N3 network (NHS, 2016). At this stage, Macmillan
data storage synchs within a minute with data storages inside N3 and deletes all
identifying patient information from the data is anonimized and data about the
concern is retained by Macmillan to gather insight into the needs of cancer patients
(consent is explicitly required from the patient in order to undertake the eHNA
and information about the use of the data is transparently provided).

The front end of the system is implemented as web-app, built using HTML and JavaScript.
Access to the assessment is restricted to scheduled appointments that clinics set up
for individual patients, either via delivering the questionnaire on the clinic site,
or, if the questionnaire is carried out remotely, via use of a one-time 6 digit PIN
number, alongside the patient's name and date of birth.

### The Concerns Checklist
Given the variety of different versions of the questionnaire, the team was advised
to focus on the one that is most commonly used: the Concerns Checklist (NCSI, 2012).

In this version of the questionnaire, the patient selects their concerns from a
range of more than 50 individual issues, each falling into one of 10 categories.
Each category may itself be a subcategory of the following major topics:

- Physical concerns
- Practical concerns
- Family concerns
- Emotional concerns
- Spiritual concerns

## Patient Data for Research in the UK
As mentioned in the project goals section in Chapter 1, handling confidential
patient data poses particular challenges to eHealth related project. Just before
the start of the project, when teams and roles had not yet been defined, the
whole team underwent training about handling patient data and the relevant
legislation in the UK (the specific certificates obtained by the author can
be found in the Appendices [#MAKESURETHISHAPPENS]).

The following is a summary of key policies the author became familiar with
before starting the project, with references to how in particular they affected
design and implementation decisions.

Generally speaking, authorization must be provided before any information provided
by the patient can be used in any way except the specific purpose of their healthcare.
This severly limits the possibility of using third party services.

First, there is no guaranteed that the information can be transmitted securely
to the external system. Secondly, this increases the risk of loss and inappropriate use of the
information, both due to mishandling by the third party (whether intentional or accidental)
and by increasing the risk that people unaware of the relevant legislation may come into contact with the data.

### The Natural Duty of Confidence
Under UK common law, information that *can* reasonably be expected
to be held in confidence under the circumstances (such as the information provided
by patients to a clinician), *must* be held in confidence.
This applies regardless of whether the information is
specifically relating to the patient's physical health, and applies to any practical
or other concern the patient may express.

Duties are sometimes contrasted with obligations in the sense that an obligation
is a voluntary covenant a person enters, whereas a duty applies to the person
regardless. This means that any personnel (including data scientists and software
developers) who work with NHS patient data can be liable for misuse of the data
even if they are not formally contracted.

### The Data Protection Act 1998
The DPA (Data Protection Act, 1998) describes eight principles meant to ensure confidential
data about (living) individuals is treated with fairness, and applies to any organization
handling such data (e.g. financial institutions).

The nature of information covered by the act is "sensitive" in the sense that it
may be used in ways that affect the subject to significant extents. Identifying
information (such as name and date of birth) is normally regarded as such.

The second principle of the DPA specifies that the purposes for which personal
data is being gathered have to be transparently described to the person. This means
that information provided by a patient for the purpose of their own health care can
only be used for this purpose and no other (including mass aggregation
of data to gather insight for any purpose from third parties involved).

The eight principle also requires that personal information is not sent outside
the European Economic Area in most cases, which can also cause problems with
the geographic location or accessibility across the world of data shared with
third parties.

### Conclusion
Patient consent should be gathered explicitly, having clearly explained all of the purposes for
which the data may be used, before any information about them can be processed (with few exceptions,
for example where the information becomes critical to national security and similar cases).

Consent should be explicitly gathered before any other information is gathered
from the patient, it may be possible to make use of third party services provided
the data has been fully anonimized and cannot be linked back to the patient, and
provided a special agreement (such as a Data Transfer Agreement) has been brokered to ensure both parties understand
the legal and ethical implications of sharing even anonimized data.
In such cases, the duty of confidence does not extend over to the third party.
Note however, that it is sometimes difficult to ensure that data has been anonimized, even
by removing all information considered personal under UK law: for example, if
a person happens to have a rare disease, or information about the geographic
location of the patient can be retrieved from the data being shared with the third
party.

For this reason, the implementation of the current project does not share any of
the data extracted from user input externally although the emphasis on clean
architecture will allow for such a choice to be made in a future iteration of
the chatbot project, where an agreement has been brokered, or authorization is
otherwise provided to make use of third party services.
