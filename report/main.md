# Introduction
> "Pointing will still be the way to express nouns as we command our machines;
> speech is surely the right way to express the verbs."
**Frederick P. Brooks Jr., 1995**

## The Problem
According to the 2014 National Cancer Patient Experience Survey National Report,
over the past couple of years only slightly over 20% of cancer patients across the UK reported having been
offered an assassment and care plan specific to their personal circumstances
(Quality Health, 2014, p. 114).
In an effort to increase the number of cancer patients who received such
assessments, Macmillan Cancer Support piloted the Holistic Needs Assessment
(HNA) questionnaire and health plan in 2008 (Macmillan, [Holistic Needs Assessment][hna]).
This is essentially a self-assessment questionnaire where the patient identifies
what their concerns are from a range of personal, physical, emotional and practical
issues they may be facing in their lives in relation to their condition.
The completion of the questionnaire is followed by the creation of a care plan
through a consultation with a clinician, with further advice and referrals as
needed. Macmillan began trialing an electronic version of the questionnaire in
2010, progressively extending provision of the eHNA to more and more sites
(clinics etc) (Mac Voice, 2014).

Intelligent conversation systems have enjoyed an increasing amount of media
attention over the last year[^aiarticles]. With applications of artificial
intelligence to using natural language inputs for different purposes, including
general purpose mobile device interfaces[^viv]. Furthermore, several technology
companies have started offering "Artificial Intelligence as a Service" products.
Among these are BloomsburyAI (founded at UCL) and bespoken companies such as
Google and Microsoft[^aiaas]. This appears indicative of the fact that chatbot
and natural language processing technologies have reached a level of maturity
comparable to that achieved years ago by haptic technology, that we find almost ubiquitously
in human-computer interfaces and everyday use of computing devices today.

This project is a about the use of an intelligent conversational system
to gather further information about the patient's concerns through an electronic
self-assessment tool, ahead of the creation of a patient care plan. This is primarily
an attempt at introducing the conversational User Interface in electronic
health applications generally, and in particular explore the applicability of
computer advisors to Macmillan's eHNA in a growing effort to improve the
quality of support cancer patients receive across the UK.

The scope of the present report is limited to the architecture and implementation of the chatbot
system, as opposed to a complete, user-facing product: the complete application is a joint effort of four,
with distinct concerns being assigned to different members of the team. The
author of the present document being tasked with design and implementation of the core system backend. The
other members of the chatbot team include: Andre Allorerung (MSc SSE) as the
technical team lead who also takes care of the integration of the system with
the resources available to PEACH and the data storage system that will persist
durably information gathered through the chatbot system. Rim Ahsaini (MSc CS)
working on a specialized search engine for resources that may interest and help
support cancer patients based on their concerns (to be available both through
conversation with the chatbot and independently), Deborah Wacks (MSc CS) as lead
UX designer working on the implementation of a webserver through which allow the
user to interact with the chatbot and search engine.

This project is part of PEACH: Platform for Enhanced Analytics and Computational
Healthcare (Project PEACH, 2016). PEACH is a data science project that
originated at University College London (UCL) in 2016 that sees Master level
candidates working together on the data platform and on related projects. With
more than twenty students across multiple Master courses, it is one of the
largest student projects undertaken in recent years at UCL, and it is part of
a long-term strategy to bring the UCL Computer Science department and the UCL Hospital
closer together.

## Project goals and personal aims
The main project goal is the delivery of a basic but easy to extend and modify
chatbot software system, specifically targeted at assisting with the identification
and gathering of information around cancer patient issues, modelled after the
Concerns Checklist (CC) electronic questionnaire form (NCSI, 2012).
Finally, one of the major challenges with eHealth problems is represented by
having to hand confidential patient data (as will be discussed in Chapter 2 of
this report). Summarily:

- Design and implement a chatbot architecture tailored to the issues surrounding
software systems in healthcare (in particular around treatment of sensitive patient data)
- To integrate with a specialized search engine (developed by another member of the team)
- To explore other applications of NLP that could be useful to extract information from natural language data.
- To implement a chatbot brain using open source technology.
- To develop the system with Macmillan eHNA as the main reference.

Personal goals of the author include:

- Learning Python in an effort to gain exposure to a new programming language
- Leverage the author's background in computational linguistics, and explore
the field of natural language processing
- Learn about applications of machine learning to natural language processing
- Improve software engineering skills by applying best Agile practices

## The project approach methodology
An Agile approach was adopted for the project, in line
with the author's stated interests. This meant maximizing time spent outside of
meetings, save for where communication between team members and others was required.
The project was paced in weekly iterations where aspects of the system to implement
would be selected from a backlog to be delivered for the next week. Great
emphasis was also put on testing as part of deveopment, in particular the discipline
of Test Driven Development.

A top-down system design and implementation was also adopted, with the next largest system
abstraction being priorized first in development in order to always have a
working system being progressively refined. These methodology guidelines where established in accordance with
the reccomendations of Brooks (1995, pp.143-144, 200-201, 267-271), Martin (2009, pp.121-133; 2003, chapter 2, 4, 5)
and Beck (Beck and Andres, 2014; Beck et al, 2001).

## Report overview
This report is structured as follows:

- Chapter 2 provides more extensive background into the eHNA questionnaire as well as
NLP and chatbot open source projects that were explored.
- Chapter 3 describes the requirements as gathered through the contacts in healthcare
and the Macmillan charity available to PEACH.
- Chapter 4 details the system architecture, design and the current implementation,
highlighting its current limits and its extensibility.
- Chapter 5 discusses how system testing was done as part of development, the
benefits of TDD to systems design and the evaluation of the machine learning component
of the system.
- Chapter 6 concludes with an evaluation of the project results, a team retrospective
and reccomendations for the direction of future work on the system.

## The electronic Health Needs Assessment questionnaire

### Macmillan Cancer Support
The eHNA system represents the background project against which the PEACH chatbot
team efforts have kept constant reference to from the project inception throughout
development.

Macmillan Cancer Support developed the eHNA for the purpose of extending the
range of cancer patients in the UK covered by individual care plans, made with
the individual's very personal and unique concerns they incurred into in relation
to their condition. These concerns are gathered through variants
of an electronic questionnaire offered by Macmillan to selected trial sites.
Paper versions and variants of the questionnaire
existed before the introduction of the eHNA in 2010, and have been in use since before then (Mac Voice, 2014) (NCAT, 2011).

The electronic questionnaire is designed to be carried out on site mostly through
haptic devices (such as tablets), just ahead of meeting the clinician that will help draft a care plan for the patient. There
is the option to complete the questionnaire remotely, although the adoption of
this alternative is made difficult by the work habits of key personnel, who are
used to providing a device to the patient in person and ask them to carry out the
questionnaire while at the clinic.

The patient uses device touch interface to navigate through various pages
selecting concern categories from a predefined list. There are several versions
of questionnaires available, modelled after the various paper versions, depending on which
one the clinic previously used.

Patients typically select three-four concerns (up to around six, mostly depending
on the type of cancer they have). The questionnaire takes on average less than
10 minutes to complete. The information extracted is first stored in a Macmillan
data store, external to the NHS N3 network (NHS, 2016). At this stage, Macmillan
data storage synchs within a minute with data storages inside N3 and deletes all
identifying patient information from the data is anonimized and data about the
concern is retained by Macmillan to gather insight into the needs of cancer patients
(consent is explicitly required from the patient in order to undertake the eHNA
and information about the use of the data is transparently provided).

The front end of the system is implemented as web-app, built using HTML and JavaScript.
Access to the assessment is restricted to scheduled appointments that clinics set up
for individual patients, either via delivering the questionnaire on the clinic site,
or, if the questionnaire is carried out remotely, via use of a one-time 6 digit PIN
number, alongside the patient's name and date of birth.

### The Concerns Checklist {#ConcernsChecklist}
Given the variety of different versions of the questionnaire, the team was advised
to focus on the one that is most commonly used: the Concerns Checklist (NCSI, 2012).

In this version of the questionnaire, the patient selects their concerns from a
range of more than 50 individual issues, each falling into one of 10 categories.
Each category may itself be a subcategory of the following major topics:

- Physical concerns
- Practical concerns
- Family concerns
- Emotional concerns
- Spiritual concerns

## Patient Data for Research in the UK
As mentioned in the project goals section in Chapter 1, handling confidential
patient data poses particular challenges to eHealth related project. Just before
the start of the project, when teams and roles had not yet been defined, the
whole team underwent training about handling patient data and the relevant
legislation in the UK (the specific certificates obtained by the author can
be found in the Appendices [#MAKESURETHISHAPPENS]).

The following is a summary of key policies the author became familiar with
before starting the project, with references to how in particular they affected
design and implementation decisions.

Generally speaking, authorization must be provided before any information provided
by the patient can be used in any way except the specific purpose of their healthcare.
This severly limits the possibility of using third party services.

First, there is no guaranteed that the information can be transmitted securely
to the external system. Secondly, this increases the risk of loss and inappropriate use of the
information, both due to mishandling by the third party (whether intentional or accidental)
and by increasing the risk that people unaware of the relevant legislation may come into contact with the data.

### The Natural Duty of Confidence
Under UK common law, information that *can* reasonably be expected
to be held in confidence under the circumstances (such as the information provided
by patients to a clinician), *must* be held in confidence.
This applies regardless of whether the information is
specifically relating to the patient's physical health, and applies to any practical
or other concern the patient may express.

Duties are sometimes contrasted with obligations in the sense that an obligation
is a voluntary covenant a person enters, whereas a duty applies to the person
regardless. This means that any personnel (including data scientists and software
developers) who work with NHS patient data can be liable for misuse of the data
even if they are not formally contracted.

### The Data Protection Act 1998
The DPA (Data Protection Act, 1998) describes eight principles meant to ensure confidential
data about (living) individuals is treated with fairness, and applies to any organization
handling such data (e.g. financial institutions).

The nature of information covered by the act is "sensitive" in the sense that it
may be used in ways that affect the subject to significant extents. Identifying
information (such as name and date of birth) is normally regarded as such.

The second principle of the DPA specifies that the purposes for which personal
data is being gathered have to be transparently described to the person. This means
that information provided by a patient for the purpose of their own health care can
only be used for this purpose and no other (including mass aggregation
of data to gather insight for any purpose from third parties involved).

The eight principle also requires that personal information is not sent outside
the European Economic Area in most cases, which can also cause problems with
the geographic location or accessibility across the world of data shared with
third parties.

### Conclusion
Patient consent should be gathered explicitly, having clearly explained all of the purposes for
which the data may be used, before any information about them can be processed (with few exceptions,
for example where the information becomes critical to national security and similar cases).

It may be possible to make use of third party services provided
the data has been fully anonimized and cannot be linked back to the patient, and
provided a special agreement (such as a Data Transfer Agreement) has been brokered to ensure both parties understand
the legal and ethical implications of sharing even anonimized data; furthermore, it would be best to also gather
consent explicitly from the patient even where the data has been anonimized.
In such cases, the duty of confidence does not extend over to the third party.
Note however, that it is sometimes difficult to ensure that data has been anonimized, even
by removing all information considered personal under UK law: for example, if
a person happens to have a rare disease, or information about the geographic
location of the patient can be retrieved from the data being shared with the third
party.

For this reason, the implementation of the current project does not share any of
the data extracted from user input externally although the emphasis on clean
architecture will allow for such a choice to be made in a future iteration of
the chatbot project, where an agreement has been brokered, or authorization is
otherwise provided to make use of third party services.

## Natural Language Processing
As stated in Chapter 1, part of the author personal aims included to learn about
NLP and leverage the author's background in computational linguistics. Furthermore,
to investigate the application of machine learning to extract information from
user input that would be relevant to the chatbot system as a whole.

To be specific, it is not so much tasks of information extraction or named entity
recognition that were identified as most useful in this case, but rather the
possibility to classify user input according to sentiment analysis and text
classification. In order to inform the chatbot system reply
to the user by providing additional information to the raw user input.
Why text classification tasks? Because they may be used to add tags to user
inputs to be matched within a chatbot brain that would otherwise be unable to
generalize.

This would effectively represent a hybrid model where both a machine learning
component and a "rule-based" (or rather input-pattern driven) approach are
used as part of a more complex system.

In the abstract, this is an attempt at exploiting the power for generalization
that is characteristic of approaches to artificial intelligence resembling
the nature of experience as a way humans acquire knowledge, human capacity (and propensity)
for inductive reasoning (Russell and Norvig, 1995, p.592; Biermann, 1986, pp.134-135;
  Hawthorne, 2014; Hume, 1777, section 4, part 2),
while at the same time retaining the rigor and control provided
by more rigid rule-based approaches to AI, which would ensure the conversation remains
on the range of topics and allows the user to carry out the information gathering phase
for the creation of their care plan, where a set of heuristics or rules of
inference is used, these in turn resemble deductive reasoning, where certainty of
the conclusion of the reasoning is guaranteed by the soundness of
the deductive calculus used, and the mathematical certainty in the premises needed
(Russell and Norvig, 1995, pp.163-165, Beall and Restall, 2014).

This approach is in particular to be contrasted with neural networks and other
approaches to AI which behave as "black boxes", and cannot by their nature proivde
an intelligible explanation of their categorization process (or more generally decision process)
as the result of their learning is stored in the form of a weighted graph (Russell and Norvig, 1995, p.567).

### Text Classification
Text classification is the NLP task of assigning a category to an input from a
predefined set of classes (Sebastiani, 2002, p.1; Manning et al, 2009, pp.256-258;
Manning and SchÃ¼tze, 1999, pp.575-576).
More formally:

For a document $d$ and a set of categories $C = \{c_1, c_2, c_3, ..., c_n\}$,
produce a predicted class $c \in C$

Particular to our case, the documents will be natural language conversational user input,
and the set of categories will be the macro cateogries of issues that have been
extracted from [the concerns checklist (CC)](#ConcernsChecklist) version of the
questionnaire (see above):

$C_{cc} = \{phyisical, practical, family, emotional, spiritual\}$

To be precise, we will be focusing on document-pivoted classification, where we
wish to approximate an ideal mapping from the set of documents $D$ to our $C_{cc}$:

$f : D \mapsto C_{cc}$

The task is normally turned into a supervised machine learning task, by training
a model over a set of document-category pairs (Sebastiani, 2011, slide 7, 13):

$\{ ... ,\langle d_i, c_j \rangle , ... \}$

Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where the machine is trained over
a set of "hand" labelled examples. The "supervision" consists in already knowing
the right answer for each training input, and wanting to use the system to
automatically label future instances as desired (Russell and Norvig, 1995, p.528).
This is in contrast with other forms of machine learning, such as reinforcement
or unsupervised learning, where the answer is either unkown or "fuzzy" unlike
with supervised learning. Take for example a robot navigating an industrial warehouse,
as the surrounding circumstances change, the behaviour desired cannot simply be
evaluated in binary terms (i.e. either "good" or "bad") because the problem of
navigating a busy environment is by its nature not binary, there is in most cases
a continuous spectrum of evaluation. NONDETERMINISTIC

A model is trained over the training set and then tested against an unseen test set,
also made up of hand-labelled samples. The model classifies each test sample and
evaluation metrics can be drawn from comparing the model classification with the
known ("gold") standard for the sample.

The internal representation of each document to the classifier is a sparse
vector representing the features or characteristics of the document relevant
to the classification task. Different features will be relevant to different document
classificaiton tasks, for example certain words may occurr more frequently in
positive movie reviews as opposed to negative movie reviews, but those particular
words are unlikely to also be indicative of whether the person who wrote the document
happened to be male or female.

These features can be, for example, the occurrence or non-occurrence in the
document of certain words (set-of-words approach) (Sebastiani, 2011, slide 66;
Manning et al, 2009, pp.271-272).
There are several categorization algorithms that may be employed, discussion is
deferred to Chapter 4.

### Sentiment Analysis

The task of sentiment analysis was also considered important for the chatbot.
The insight to extract from the raw natural language user input was deemed
important to the assessment of the user distress level with respect to issues
the user would be discussing with the chatbot.

As described in Chapter 3, however, this task became secondary to the purpose of
the first implementation, and was therefore never implemented. Nevertheless,
for future references, the theoretical resources discovered as part of the
background investigation for the current project.

Sentiment analysis can be seen as a type of text classification where the document is to be
classified into categories of either positive or negative feeling ($C_{sa} = \{positive, negative\}$).

Therefore, a simple sentiment analyzer can be nothing more than a text categorizer,
which may be built through the same set-of-words approach outlined at the end of
the previous section (this approach is sometimes called "sentiment classification",
Liu, 2010, p.628, 637--). This simple approach has obvious shortcomings: for one, some words
change polarity (postive or negative) depending on the context (Ding, Liu and Yu, 2008, abstract).
For example, the word "great" may in general be more likely to be found in positive as opposed to
negative movie reviews (for example), but it is easy to imagine a negative review
where the word also occur (e.g. "great disappointment").

Secondly, the sort of documents we are interested in analyzing will be for the
most part short sentences, part of a conversation. Hence the additional difficulty
of having to keep track of the present topic given the conversational context:
the "volleys" of messages exchanged between user and system, as well as which user inputs are
relevant to one topic rather than another.

A more interesting approach may involve, instead, first deciding whether the
document is expressing a subjective evaluation or an objective statement ("I hate the world"
contrasted with "it is raining"), and if the first, then whether the polarity of
the statement is either positive or negative (Liu, 2010, pp.640--). This approach may be relatively easy
to implement (compared to more advanced information retrieval approaches, that may
want to also extract what the object of the sentiment is, and what the nature of the
sentiment is) and may enable some of the distresses of the patient and the object
of these to be extracted from the conversation. As we will see in the Requirements
section of the report (Chapter 3), the requirements for the current project are
significantly more modest than that.

### Open Source NLP Libraries

The open source NLP libraries that were considered as part of the project were
the ones that could easily be used with the Python programming language (in line with
the author's personal aims), so long as the open source tools available for Python
proved sufficient for the project purposes. This excluded, for example, the OpenNLP Apache library, due to its focus on Java
(Apache, 2015).

The second desideratum was for all PEACH subprojects involving some
degree of NLP to use the same family of technologies and open source packages.
This was meant to make it easier to reuse results from the current iteration in
the future and build a common base so that the different subprojects may draw from each
other work, and contribute to the creation of shared software packages for the PEACH
project.

It was decided, primarily based on the experience of the memebers of the
PEACH team that had previously worked with NLP to use the Natural Lanugage Tool-Kit
(NLTK) as a baseline, but to not be afraid to adopt other tools as needed by
individual projects (Bird, Klein and Loper, 2015). The decision was also made on the basis of
the expected needs of the individual subprojects based on the requirements gathered
in collaboration with Dr Ramachandran: the NLTK is a versitile, general purpose suite
of NLP tools. Its focus on Python also made it a better solution with respect to
other suites such as the Stanford CoreNLP, due to lack of extensive Python bindings
from the Java implementation (Manning et al, 2014; Smith, 2014).

The present project thus made primarily use of the NLTK for most of its NLP needs.
No other frameworks were used for NLP general purposes specifically (such as tokenization and stemming,
even classification), althought other tools
where used in areas related to NLP, for the implementation of the chatbot brain and
for the generation of synonyms, as reported below.

### Categorizing text with the NLTK

The NLTK documentation provides a well written introductory tutorial to text
categorization and supervised learning (Bird et al, 2015, Chapter 6). The author found
helpful in particular the way the train/dev/test split is justified and used (Ibid, section 1.2).

In supervised machine learning generally, the set of all data points available is
normally split into three disjunct subsets. The training set is used to create a representation,
internal to the classifier, of the propeties of the data points that are relevant
to deciding their categories (the "features"). This is normally the largest set in the split.
The development set is used to improve the feature extraction: the example in
Chapter 6 of the NLTK book shows how the performance of a classifier can be improved
in this way (see also Manning et al, 2009, pp.271--).

The task is classifying proper names into genders. At first, the only feature that
is considered is what the last letter of the name is, with the classifier surveying
the distribution of letters in the training sample and "learning" what the proper label
is by being given the answer. Then, feature extraction is improved by looking also
at other features, such as the length of the name and what the initial letter is.

Thus the development set is used in an intermediate testing stage, before proceeding
to test the classifier against the yet unseen test subset of the original set of all
data points. A classifier is evaluated by looking at certain metrics of its perfomance during
testing. A very simple metric is accuracy: the number of correctly labelled
data points against the expected label. It may also be useful to build a "confusion matrix".

In this matrix, the diagonal represents the percentage of correctly labelled samples,
the column for each category for cells not lying on the diagonal represent the percentage
of times the labelled indicated by the column was mistaken for the labelled indicated in the row.
A simple graphical representation of such a matrix can be obtained via the *confusionmatrix*
module of the *metrics* subpackage of the NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/metrics/confusionmatrix.html.

The NLTK exposes a range of natural language corpora and a machine learning package
(aptly named "classify") where implementations of single and multi-category
classifiers can be found (https://github.com/nltk/nltk/tree/develop/nltk/classify).
A "corpus" is a collection of related natural language resources, used for a variety
of purposes in NLP, such as training of classifiers (SIGLEX, undated). For example, it is possible to
train a sentiment analysis classifier over a corpus of movie reviews.

Of interest to the present projects where the ready available implementations of
various types of single-label classifiers, and the intuitive API they expose.
These classifiers are implemented as simple Python objects, to be instantiatiated,
trained and producing a label for an input after training.

These classifiers are very easy to use when data is available. An obvious problem
with the present project is that no data of the relevant shape was available whatsoever.
The type of data we wanted our classifier to produce a label for was a short chat
message. The label had to be in the specified range of categories, in order to
better inform the chatbot with the capacity for generalization of a machine learning
approach. There is no corpus of pairs of message - label of the relevant kind
(a member of $C_{cc} = \{phyisical, practical, family, emotional, spiritual\}$, formally).

Therefore, the author created a survey that Dr Ramachandran was kind enough to mandate
completion of through the team (the survey can be found here: https://goo.gl/forms/ylkI50XckV9yvCCm2).
This resulted in 250 data points. By data point
here is meant a single unit of data relevant for the purpose, in this case, a
chat message - label pair. Given the time, however, that it took for the collection
of these data points, the project was out of time before they could be put to use
with the current implementation, unfortunately.

Even if a classifier was trained and saved over a suitable split of this
data, it would still be necessary to go through a development stage, where
the feature extractor was further and further refined, to improve the performance
of the classifier against the dev set, before moving on to evaluation proper.

Conveniently, feature extractors can be used with an NLTK classifier instances as
simple functions (or lambda expressions) that return a dictionary (or map) of
arbitrarily named features to values. More specifically, an NLTK classifier
takes its input (or set of inputs) as instances of such maps.

#### Advanced Research into Categorization

So far, we have looked at how classifiers would be used to give labels to distinct
documents, however, as noted earlier, the documents we are interested in classifying
are not independent from each other: a conversation is a rich in context, and no
feature of the approach outlined so far even considers this aspect of the problem.

One thing we could do to improve the classifier is to provide a level of uncertainty,
where user inputs may fail to be assigned any of the predefined labels. This not an
attempt to account for essentially neutral inputs such as "Yes" or "I don't know",
that do not contribute to establishing the topic of the conversation. This is rather
a way to try and account for indeterminateness of the topic at hand.

If a patient were to mention an issue that scores a reasonable confidence level from
the classifier in both emotional and family categories, but both scores are below
a certain threshold, then perhaps the best thing for the classifier is to not assign
a label to the input. This accounts for the inherent "fuzziness" of certain topics of discussion.

Something else we could do is consider conversation topics as the states in a
finite state machine, and account for varying probabilities to move into different
topics, given the current state. Emotional issues many, for example, seem closer to family
issues than physical issues. However, this seems quite an ambitious architecture to
impose over a simple classifier, which leads us onto the next topic.

#### Sequence Classifiers

A sequence classifier is similar to a single or multi-lable classifier, except
it considers each data point as a member of a sequence: the data points are assigned
labels not independently of each other but as part of one sequence (Bird et al, 2015, Chapter 6 sections 1.6-1.7;
Jurafsky and Martin, 2014, p.1).

This type of classifier intuitively better suits the task of classifying sequences
of utterances in a conversation, than a classifier that only decides a label for
the input considered in isolation.

A Markov chain is a weighted finite state automaton (a directed weighted graph
with a finite number of nodes), where the weight on all transitions from any state
represent the probability of moving to the state the transition points to (Jurafsky and Martin, 2014, p.2).
[#PICTUREWOULDBENICE?]

More formally:
A set of states:
$Q = \{q_1, q_2, ..., q_n\}$
A transition probability matrix:
$A = \{ a_{01}, a_{02}, ..., a_{n1}, ...,  a_{nn}\}$
And a start and an end (accepting) state: $q_0, q_F$

A Markov chain may already be sufficient for us to do some useful modelling. In particular,
we may construct a simple (ergodic, fully connected) directed weighted graph (with appropriate constraints on the
weights to represent a probability distribution from each state) that connects our five states together
represeting the macro categories of concerns in the CC. Having manually set probabilities
for state transitions, we would use our simple classifier to decide the category
for the next user input in isolation, then confront this result against the likelihood
of a transition in that direction, before finally deciding the label.

We could take the problem one step further: a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a generalization
of a Markov chain that distinguishes between observed and hidden events. For example,
in a part of speech tagging task, the observed is the surface level sequence of words,
the hidden is the sequence of tags describing the syntactic structure of the
utterance. This distiction would allow, in our case, to distinguish between a sequence
of natural language user inputs, and the sequence of conversational topics "hidden"
within.

Formally, to the properties of a Markov chain outlined above we add:
A sequence of non-hidden observations:
$O = \langle o_1, o_2, ... o_m\rangle$
A function describing the probability of observation $o_j$ being generated (called probability of emission) from state $i$:
$b_i : O \mapsto [0. 1]$

The tasks that Jurafsky and Martin identify for such models are three (ibid, p.6):
- Likelihood: given a model M and a sequence of observations $O$, determine $P(O|M)$
- Decoding: given a model M and a sequence of observations $O$, determine the "best" corresponding
sequence of states $Q$
- Training: given an observation sequence $O$ and a set (not a sequence) of states $Q$,
train a model M

For our problem: at any point during the conversation, we are really interested
 in determining the probability distribution of the *reachable states* given the sequence of observations
and the corresponding sequence of states so far identified, in order to determine
what the best *next state* is. Given the next observation,
we compute the probability of emission of that observation from all the plausible states
reachable from the current state. We then may want to do a harmonized average of
these probabilities and the known state transition probabilites, in order to decide
the next state (the next label for the user input in our case).

The problem that still needs to be addressed is how we determine the emission probability
distribution. The user input will likely vary from session to session: no two sequences
of user inputs, representing the half of the conversation the user contributes, are
going to be alike.

It may be possible to reduce each user input to a set of semantically salient terms,
terms that are associated with one or another topic. For example, mention of
proper names or nouns denoting family members (such as mother, aunt etc) may be
indicative that the topic is family. In contrast, terms associated with emotional
problems may be indicative of the topic being emotional issues. In a way, we are returning
back to a simple classifier to decide what the observation to be then fed to the
sequence classifier may be.

#### The limits of the NLTK

Unfortunately the implementation produced does not make use of sequence classification, but
instead uses simple classifiers that consider each user input in isolation. There are two
reasons for this.

The first is that, as may have become evident through the preceeding section, the
problem is complex enough to warrant exploration in a separate dissertation. And
given that the focus of the current project is laying down the fundamental architecture
of a chatbot for eHealth applicaitons, to dedicate more resources to this topic would
require neglecting other, perhaps more important aspects of the problem to be solved.

The second is that the NLTK does not provide the implementation of any sequence
classifier (at the time of writing). Looking through the public open source
repository it is possible to see that an interface sequence classifiers would be
expected to conform to within the NTLK package has been written, but is commented out
in the code, and no implementation
of the interface can be found: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/991f2cd1e31f7c1ad144589ab4d2c76bee05aa7b/nltk/classify/api.py
(the link should reference the latest commit to the NLTK project as of 21/08/16).

There are open source implementations of Hidden Markov Models available, but
work would be required in order to either fit these to the NTLK system, or to
incorporate them within the current project. See for example, "pomegranate"
here: https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate#hidden-markov-models (Schreiber et al, 2016).

## The Chatbot

The very high level general architecture of a chatbot system is normally described in terms of
(Bird et al, 2015, Chapter 1 section 5.5; Jurafsky and Martin, 2009, pp.857-867):
1. A natural language understanding layer
2. A diaglogue and or task manager
3. A natural language generation layer

The first may be simply implemented through hand-written finite state or context free
grammars. The system takes in the user input and attempts to parse it according
to predefined grammar rules in order to extract the relevant information (Jurafsky and Martin, ibid, p.859).
A way to avoid having to hand-write the grammar rules is by making use of a probabilistic
parser that also seeks to fill-in slots of information required by the system to carry
out the task (ibid. p.860).

The simplest way to address number 3 is to have a set of hand-written natural language
templates that are filled in with relevant information before being output to
the user. Finally, the dialogue or task manager would be what models the information
required of the user for the completion of the task, and manages the turn taking
and the grammar rules to match for the user inputs and the templates to use in
output.

This type of rudimentary system can be contrasted with more complex systems
that include modelling of the conversational context and understanding and generation
modules that can operate with higher level abtraction than mere patterns of symbols
(like the grammar rules and templates described above), which we may want to
call "dialogue acts". These more advanced systems are sometimes referred to
"information-state" systems as opposed to "frame-based" systems that coerce
the conversation to a very specific task.

For the purposes of the problem at hand, it is difficult to decide which of these
would be ideal. For one, the tight control over the topics in the conversation
provides a good way to ensure the user does not get distracted into trying
to ask the system questions that are irrelevant to the gathering and extraction
of user concerns. On the other hand, especially where the system is being used
without previously gathered knowledge about what the categories of concerns of the
user are, it may be more suitable to have a general purpose "information-state"
system, capable of carrying out a conversation with the user.

### The Chatbot "Brain" Market

This section aims at describing the options that were discovered while researching
ways to set up an initial chatbot. A lot of the open source projects available
make use of the patter/grammar and template model described above, but there is
a notable alternative in the emerging (yet immature) technology of using neural networks or
similar tools to build conversational models. Finally, as a last resort, there are
AIaaS providers: providers of remote intelligent agents and related services [^aiaas], similarly to
the web hosting solutions of Amazon or Microsoft (AWS, 2016; Azure 2016).
For the reasons outlined in the above section on the particular legal issues around
the problem domain, it was deemed unfeasible to use external services that would
host the chatbot service and as a consequence receive and process patient information (even in anonimized form).

Exploring the open source chatbot "market" it is easy to appreciate how this world
has mostly been evolving outside of academia. The main sources for this section of
the report are the individual websites of the tools explored, and the forum of
https://www.chatbots.org/ai_zone/ and related readings (Morton, 2011; Wilcox, 2011).

In the architecture model proposed above, these systems take care of
making it easy to write documents that define the patterns and templates of a "frame-based"
system, simplifying the process to build all three of the above defined layers.
We now proceed to review the various options, and motivate the choice of standard
used in this project.

#### The Artificial intelligence Markup Language

AiML is a version of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that was specifically
designed around providing a framework to define rules, patterns and grammars to
match user inputs to appropriate template. The language was also created with the
objective of providing a transferrable standard. On top of the basic patterns and
template, AiML provides ways to use wildcards or optional sub-patterns in the
input pattern and to capture parts of the user input for processing or to repeat
back by adding it to the template.

AiML also provides ways to define topics as restrictions over the set of matchable
patterns. Entering a topic effectively means restricting the patterns that user
input can match to the ones associated with the topic. It is also possible to
set and read internal variables tied to one user, and use this state in conditionals
to decide which template to use in the output; it is possible to refer back to
the previously matched input, for example to read a follow up to a yes-no question
(see http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html; Wallace, 2014).

AiML is only a standard for defining this information, and there are separate guidelines
to follow to implement a AiML reader (or "interpreter"). The set of files making up
the AiML "bot" are commonly called the chatbot "brain". There are a number of interpreters available for AiML in various programming languages,
and there are freely available "libraries" of AiML files for others to include
into their own chatbot (Wallace, 2011; Pandorabots, 2016; http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/sets.html,
http://www.square-bear.co.uk/aiml/).

#### RiveScript

RiveScript is an alternative standard to AiML the objectives of which are to be
as expressive and useful as AiML, but with a simpler syntax, getting rid of the XML
(Petherbridge, 2009; Petherbridge, 2012; https://www.rivescript.com/compare/aiml). Like AiML,
RiveScript has support for topics, remote procedure calls, conditionals, redirections
and other features. One thing that will be particularly relevant for the remainder
of the discussion is the possibility to define "arrays" or sets of equivalent terms.
This seemed useful to the author to define synonyms and allow certain patterns of user
expression to be captured if they matched some synonym.

But what made RiveScript particularly attractive was not just its simpler syntax,
it was rather the fact that (at the time of writing) there are no easily traceable
AiML interpreters implemented in Python. The best candidates are pyAIML and pyAiml-2.0
(Tomer, 2014; Iaia, 2016), neither of which has either been maintained for a long time,
or is very stable. This also applies to most other open source AiML interpreters
implementations at the time of writing (ALICE A.I. Foundation, 2014; Morton and Perreau, 2014).

#### ChatScript

ChatScript is in many ways similar to RiveScript in that it instead of extending XML
it wishes to have a very easy to read syntax. In ChatScript, it is possible to
define "concepts" like RiveScript "arrays". ChatScript also is also integrated in WordNet: a
lexical database for the English language that primarily models synonimity and hyponimity
between English words (Fellbaum, 2005).

ChatScript also supports external procedure calls, wildcards, optional sub-patterns
and the other pattern matching features of the previous standards. Something that
put the only ChatScript interpreter aside from the other standards examined is
that for one, there is only one and no other open source interpreter projects.
Secondly, the interpreter is implemented in C++.

#### SuperScript

SuperScript is a fork of RiveScript with syntax elements inspired by ChatScript
().
