	abstract = {A good argument is one whose conclusions follow from its premises;its conclusions are consequences of its premises. But in whatsense do conclusions follow from premises? What is it for aconclusion to be a consequence of premises? Those questions,in many respects, are at the heart of logic (as a philosophicaldiscipline). Consider the following argument:, There are many different things one can say about this argument, butmany agree that if we do not equivocate (if the terms mean the samething in the premises and the conclusion) then the argument isvalid, that is, the conclusion follows deductively from thepremises. This does not mean that the conclusion is true. Perhaps thepremises are not true. However, if the premises are true, then theconclusion is also true, as a matter of logic. This entry is about therelation between premises and conclusions in valid arguments., Contemporary analyses of the concept of consequence—of thefollows from relation—take it to be bothnecessary and formal, with such answers often beingexplicated via proofs or models (or, in some cases,both). Our aim in this article is to provide a brief characterisationof some of the notions that play a central role in contemporaryaccounts of logical consequence., We should note that we only highlight a few of thephilosophical aspects of logical consequence, leaving outalmost all technical details, and also leaving out a large number ofphilosophical debates about the topic. Our rationale for doing as muchis that one will get the technical details, and the particularphilosophical issues that motivated them, from looking at specificlogics—specific theories of logical consequence (e.g.,relevant logics, substructural logics, non-monotonic logics, dynamiclogics, modal logics, theories of quantification, and so on).(Moreover, debates about almost any feature oflanguage—structure versus form of sentences, propositions,context sensitivity, meaning, even truth—are relevant to debatesabout logical consequence, making an exhaustive discussion practicallyimpossible.)  Our aim here is simply to touch on a few of the verybasic issues that are central to logical consequence.},

	title = {Inductive {Logic}},
	url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/logic-inductive/},
	abstract = {An inductive logic is a system of evidential support that extendsdeductive logic to less-than-certain inferences. For valid deductivearguments the premises logically entail the conclusion, wherethe entailment means that the truth of the premises provides aguarantee of the truth of the conclusion. Similarly, in a good inductive argument the premises should provide some degree of support for the conclusion, where such support means that the truth of the premises indicates with some degree of strength that the conclusion is true. Presumably, if the logic of good inductive arguments is to be of any real value, the measure of support it articulates should meet the following condition: ,   This article will focus on the kind of the approach to inductive logic most widely studied by philosophers and logicians in recent years. These logics employ conditional probability functions to  represent measures of the degree to which evidence statements support hypotheses. This kind of approach usually draws on Bayes' theorem, which is a theorem of probability theory, to articulate how the implications of hypotheses about evidence claims influences the degree to which hypotheses are supported  by those evidence claims. We will examine the extent to which this  kind of logic may pass muster as an adequate logic of evidential support, especially in regard to the testing of scientific hypotheses. In particular, we will see how such a logic may be shown to satisfy the Criterion of Adequacy., Sections 1 through 3 present all of the main ideas behind the probabilistic logic of evidential support. For most readers these three sections will suffice to provide an adequate understanding of the subject. Those readers who want to know more about how the logic applies when the implications of hypotheses about evidence claims (called likelihoods) are vague or imprecise may, after reading sections 1-3, skip down to section 6., Sections 4 and 5 are for the more advanced reader who wants a detailed  understanding of some telling results about how this logic may bring   about convergence to the truth. These results show that the Criterion of   Adequacy is indeed satisfied—that as evidence accumulates, false hypotheses will very probably come to have evidential support values (as measured by their posterior probabilities) that approach 0; and as this happens, a true hypothesis will very probably acquire evidential support values (as measured by their posterior probabilities) that approach 1.},

	abstract = {The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.},

A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well.},

	abstract = {One of the important types of information on the Web is the opinions expressed in the user generated content, e.g., customer reviews of products, forum posts, and blogs. In this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. In particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. This problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. Most existing techniques utilize a list of opinion (bearing) words (also called opinion lexicon) for the purpose. Opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. These approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. This approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. It also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. It also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. A system, called Opinion Observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. Experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. It outperforms existing methods significantly},

  Basically, there are several options available to the prospective new botmaster for creating a new chatbot, and while I can’t cover every option here, I’ll try to briefly cover some of the more popular options, citing advantages and disadvantages of each. Then I’ll outline a couple of brief, step by step guides to setting up your own chatbot; one of them a stand-alone bot app, and the other one a web-based chatbot.

Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.},
